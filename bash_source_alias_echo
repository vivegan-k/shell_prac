Bash_startup
============

.bash_profile is read when Bash is invoked as a login shell

.bashrc is executed when a new shell is started

If you extend an exported variable like PATH in .bashrc, it will grow with each nested shell invocation

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

Example:
--------
Add following line in .bashrc : export xyz=$xyz:some-stuff

And then:
[vivk@vivk ~]$ vi .bashrc 
[vivk@vivk ~]$ echo $xyz

[vivk@vivk ~]$ bash
[vivk@vivk ~]$ echo $xyz
:some-stuff
[vivk@vivk ~]$ echo $xyz
:some-stuff
[vivk@vivk ~]$ bash
[vivk@vivk ~]$ echo $xyz
:some-stuff:some-stuff
[vivk@vivk ~]$ exit
exit


Source:
=======

source example.sh or . example.sh

It is "dot space" as a short way to source a script

The shell executed the scrip in the shell's own process instead of in a new process

Souring is a common way to import variable assignments or functions

Alias:
=====

alias ll="ls -l"

alias copy=cp

alias mroe=more

To list available alias: `alias`

To set alias permanently:
-------------------------
Set it in .bashrc file (alias v=vim)
source .bashrc
