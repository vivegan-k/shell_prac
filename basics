Basics
------

First two characters should be shebang (#!) - This is executed via kernal system called execve() function

So ./myscript with #!/bin/bash would be executed as /bin/bash ./myscript.sh

Change scripts executable 'chmod u+x' (Adds execute(x) permission to user(u))

Time command:
-------------

how much time taken for executing the command:

[vivk@vivk ~]$ time find . -name vivek

real	0m1.216s # how long it takes in realtime with stop watch
user	0m0.253s #cpu time
sys	0m0.348s # cpu time

Variables in bash:
------------------

Variables in bash commands are given with symbol(=)
No spaces should be given before or after =
If there any special chars or spaces, value should be given in quotes

Remove variables with unset command

print variable with $var

     echo myvar is $myvar
     
Make something as env variable

    export myvar=something
    
To view vaiables which are exported:

     export
     
 Grouping in bash:
 -----------------
 
 a=1
 {
 a=2
 }
 echo $a
 #prints 2
 
  a=1
 (
 a=2
 )
 echo $a
 #prints 1
 
 Bash builtins
 -------------
 
 To enable bash builtins
        enable
        
  Example:
  --------
  a = 5
  export a
  echo $a #prints 5
  
  To see keywords in bash:
  -------------------------
       compgen -k
